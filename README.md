For sharing files with workshop participants at [AECTech+ Barcelona 2024](https://www.aectech.us/aectech-barcelona).

If you are unfamiliar/rusty with GHPython I would suggest flipping through my BIG Academy beginners course (download [GH103 Slideshow](https://andersholdendeleuran.com/211103_Grasshopper103_CPH_Redacted.pdf)) and perhaps have a quick fiddle with [some of the exercises](https://github.com/AndersDeleuran/AECTechPlus24/tree/main/GH103_Exercises):
